# ContactsManager

**Application Description:**<br/>
This is a simple CRUD Application that allows users to add, edit, delete and list/view contacts.

**Warning:**</br>
Please note that the rich text editor on the edit page loads slowly in <b>CHROME</b> if the content size is too large (if you've added pictures or videos).
If you are using this application in chrome and want to put images and videos in the rich text editor (description) feild, it is best if the files be kept under or around 10MB in size.
This is a known issue with chrome and I couldn't really find a way around it. For optimum performance run the application in Firefox.
